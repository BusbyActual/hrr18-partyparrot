CAM.IO is an Event promotion tool. The aim of CAM.IO is to allow event organizers to post events, with incentives for promoters who get the highest number of clicks on their unique URL.

* **Organizers:** CAM.IO makes it easy to gamify the event promotion process. We are your connection to the social influencers, who will help make your event a success.
* **Promoters:** Discover events that your audience will care about, and win big rewards just by leveraging your network.
